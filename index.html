  <h1>Book Review: The Rosie Project</h1>
  <p>This book came with a commanding recommendation from a good friend, "best book ever". 
  I hadn't read a novel in more than 5 years, and to break that streak, I was being recommended a love story. To top this, Bill Gates included it in his summer reading list (https://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/6-Books-I-Would-Recommend-Summer-Reading) I therefore had extremely high expectations. 
  
 I started reading this book at midgnight. 4 hours later, my bed time read had turned into the book that kept me awake past mignight. I finished the book before sleeping joyfully thinking about the story. 
 
 The plot of "The Rosie Project" is gripping, funny and embedded with nerdy facts. I smiled and laughed quite a bit. It's been a while since I had read a novel with magic powers to uplift your mood. 
 
 The protagonist Don Tillman, is an unmarried genetics professor with a penchant for rationality, organization and science. He finds comfort and mind peace in everyday chores. Some highlights from the book which are worth implementing in our lives: 
 ** Cooking meals and the adoption of the "Standardized Meal System" -  Excellent food, superior to most restaurants at a much lower price 
 ** Scheduling meetings and deliberate planning of activites on calendar. He asks a very pertinent question: "Why do people value othersâ€™ time so little? 
 
  My friends who have read this book were of the opinion that Don Tillman is the Sheldon Cooper (from the popular TV series The Big Bang Theory) of Genetics from Australia. 
  
  I however felt that Professor Don Tillman is realistic, more likeable character in comparison to Sheldon Cooper. Chief among these differences being: 
  ** Independence: Don Tillman doesn't depend on another human being to protect him/drive him around. 
  ** Maturity: Don Tillman doesn't whine or project weakness. 
  
  If you are looking for an escape for a few hours (It's a short read at 290 pages), look no further than the Rosie Project by Graeme Simison.
