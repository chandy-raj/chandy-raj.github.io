  <h1>Book Review: The Rosie Project</h1>
  <p>
  
  This book came with a commanding recommendation from a good friend, "best book ever". 
  I hadn't read a novel in more than 5 years, and to break that streak with a love story sounded abominable. To top this, I discovered that Bill Gates had included it in his  <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/6-Books-I-Would-Recommend-Summer-Reading">2014 summer reading list</a>. I therefore had a high bar for the book when I decided to take the plunge.<br> <br>
  
 I started reading this book at midgnight. 4 hours later, my bed time read had turned into the book-that-kept-me-awake-way-past-mignight read. The plot of "The Rosie Project" is gripping, funny and embedded with nerdy facts. I smiled and laughed quite a bit. It's been a while since I had read a novel with magic powers to uplift your mood. <br><br>
 
 The protagonist Don Tillman, is an unmarried genetics professor with a penchant for rationality, organization and science. He finds comfort and mind peace in routine, planning and habits. Some highlights from the book which are worth implementing in our lives:
<dd>- Cooking meals and the adoption of the "Standardized Meal System". One of the benefits being "Excellent food, superior to most restaurants at a much lower price" <br>
	- Scheduling meetings and deliberate planning of activites on calendar. He asks a very pertinent question: "Why do people value othersâ€™ time so little? </dd> <br>
 
 My friends who have read this book were of the opinion that Don Tillman is the Sheldon Cooper (from the popular TV series The Big Bang Theory) of Genetics from Australia. I however felt that Professor Don Tillman is a realistic and more likeable character in comparison to Sheldon Cooper. Chief among these differences being: <br>
  <dd>- Independence: Don Tillman doesn't depend on another human being to protect him/drive him around. <br>
 - Maturity: Don Tillman doesn't whine or project weakness. </dd>  
  If you are looking for an escape for a few hours (It's a short read at 290 pages), look no further than the Rosie Project by Graeme Simison. <br><br>
